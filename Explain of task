– You are given a water level information L. Condition: 0<L<128.
– You are given a terrain information (elevation matrix M). Condition: 0≤M[i][j]<128 ∀i,j<512.
– Calculate how many islands are formed and return a coordinate value for each island.
– Definition of an island: An island is the collection of terrain points( elevation values M[i][j]), above
water( greater than L value), from which you can find a path to any other without having to pass the
path through water.
– Definition of a path: A path is an ordered set of points where successive points have either their X
coordinates the same and their Y coordinates different only by one in magnitude (so can be y - 1 or y +
1); or have their Y coordinates the same and have their X coordinates different only by one in magnitude
(so can be x - 1 or x + 1). But not both of them: in other words they have to touch either in the X
direction or in the Y direction, and not in the diagonal.
– If a piece of terrain is partially (or fully) located (touching) at the edge(s) of the 512 × 512 grid, still it
will count as an island.

• First line is a single integer. (The L value)
• The rest of the file has 262144 integers. Skip all the whitespace and read all of these integers and create a
512x512 matrix. Integers are listed in row-order.
output.txt
• The first line is an integer (number of islands)
• Each line after the first line holds coordinate information of a point on an island. (single point for each island)
• Example: Here there are 5 islands. (#... are comments, which are not printed.)
5
x_coordinate1 y_coordinate1 #coordinate of a point which is on island1
x_coordinate2 y_coordinate2 #coordinate of a point which is on island2
x_coordinate3 y_coordinate3 #coordinate of a point which is on island3
x_coordinate4 y_coordinate4 #coordinate of a point which is on island4
x_coordinate5 y_coordinate5 #coordinate of a point which is on island5
