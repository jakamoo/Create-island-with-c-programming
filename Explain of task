– You are given a water level information L. Condition: 0<L<128.
– You are given a terrain information (elevation matrix M). Condition: 0≤M[i][j]<128 ∀i,j<512.
– Calculate how many islands are formed and return a coordinate value for each island.
– Definition of an island: An island is the collection of terrain points( elevation values M[i][j]), above
water( greater than L value), from which you can find a path to any other without having to pass the
path through water.
– Definition of a path: A path is an ordered set of points where successive points have either their X
coordinates the same and their Y coordinates different only by one in magnitude (so can be y - 1 or y +
1); or have their Y coordinates the same and have their X coordinates different only by one in magnitude
(so can be x - 1 or x + 1). But not both of them: in other words they have to touch either in the X
direction or in the Y direction, and not in the diagonal.
– If a piece of terrain is partially (or fully) located (touching) at the edge(s) of the 512 × 512 grid, still it
will count as an island.
